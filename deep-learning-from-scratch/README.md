# Deep Learning from Scratch

This folder contains tutorials and study materials for the **Intermediate MLP & CNN** phase of the RATEL AI Study Group. 

## Steps

1. 📝 **Tutorials**: Refer to `TUTORIALS.MD` for detailed guides. *Video tutorials are included.*
   
2. ⚙️ **Running Code**: Thoroughly read the book while running the provided code examples as outlined in the tutorials. Focus on understanding the core concepts behind each implementation.  

3. 📂 **Exploring Projects**: Work through the `Projects_example.ipynb` file, which demonstrates how to apply MLP and CNN algorithms to public datasets. The project emphasizes comparing the accuracy of these algorithms to provide hands-on experience with real-world data. *Videos will be added soon.*

4. 🎯 **Assignment**: Choose one of the following tasks and present your findings in a PowerPoint presentation:
   - Analyze the accuracy of MLP and CNN using the MNIST dataset introduced in the book.
   - Obtain a public dataset from Kaggle, apply the same accuracy comparison between MLP and CNN, and share your results. *Videos will be added soon.*
