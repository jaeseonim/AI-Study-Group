# AI Study Group

## Introduction to RATEL and the AI Study

RATEL is an interdisciplinary studies club at Dankook University. The club was founded in 2024 by a group of peers from the same class, including myself. I currently serve as the AI study leader and have been managing the study sessions since its inception.

In March 2024, the group started with 14 members, and we welcomed 4 new members in September. With no prior experience in AI or coding, I initially faced challenges in managing the study sessions effectively. Nonetheless, I embraced my role as a leader and consistently worked to enhance my knowledge to better support members' questions.

We have now established a structured 3-step study plan as outlined below.
