# AI Study Group

This repository documents the AI study activities conducted by **RATEL**, a club at Dankook University College of Medicine.

## 🐾 Introduction to RATEL and the AI Study

RATEL is an academic club at Dankook University that focuses on book discussions and AI studies. It was founded in 2024 by myself and my peers. I currently serve as the AI study leader and have been managing the study sessions since its inception.

In March 2024, the group started with 14 members, and we welcomed 4 new members in September. As someone with no prior experience in AI or coding, I initially struggled to manage the study sessions effectively. However, I took on the responsibility as a leader and made continuous efforts to learn more, so I could better assist members with their questions.

We have now established a structured 4-step study plan as outlined below.

## 📚 Study Progression

1. **Introduction to Neural Networks**
   
   - Book: *Make Your Own Neural Network* (신경망 첫걸음)
   - **Hands-on Project**: Build a handwritten digit recognition program.

2. **Intermediate Neural Networks & CNN (Convolution Neural Network)**
   
   - Book: *Deep Learning from Scratch* (밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝)
   - **Hands-on Project**: Apply algorithms introduced in the book to public image datasets.
     
3. **RNN (Recurent Neural Network)**
   - Book: *Deep Learning from Scratch 2* (밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 2)
   - **Hands-on Project**: *To be decided.* (This stage is yet to be implemented.)

4. **AI Paper Sharing**  
   - Members share and discuss papers on topics they find interesting.  
   - *This stage is still in the planning phase.*

## 🎯 Study Goals

- ✅ Build foundational and intermediate knowledge of AI to prepare for the AI-driven future.  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience by writing and implementing code.  
- ✅ Collaborate and grow with peers who share similar interests in AI and its applications in medicine.
