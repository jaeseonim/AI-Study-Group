# AI Study Group

This repository documents the AI study activities conducted by **RATEL**, a club at Dankook University College of Medicine.

## 🐾 Introduction to RATEL and the AI Study

RATEL is an academic club at Dankook University that focuses on book discussions and AI studies. The club was founded in 2024 by a group of peers from the same class, including myself. I currently serve as the AI study leader and have been managing the study sessions since its inception.

In March 2024, the group started with 14 members, and we welcomed 4 new members in September. As someone with no prior experience in AI or coding, I initially struggled to manage the study sessions effectively. However, I took on the responsibility as a leader and made continuous efforts to learn more, so I could better assist members with their questions.

We have now established a structured 4-step study plan as outlined below.

## 📚 Study Progression

1. **Introduction to Neural Networks**
   - **Book**: [*Make Your Own Neural Network* (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network/dp/1530826608) | [신경망 첫걸음 (교보문고)](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001057736)
   - **Hands-on Project**: Build a handwritten digit recognition program.

2. **Intermediate Neural Networks & CNN (Convolution Neural Network)**
   - **Book**: [*Deep Learning from Scratch* (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Scratch-Building-Principles/dp/1492041416) | [밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 (교보문고)](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001057805)
   - **Hands-on Project**: Apply algorithms introduced in the book to public image datasets.

3. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
   - **Book**: [*Deep Learning from Scratch 2* (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4-%E5%BA%B7%E6%AF%85/dp/4873118360) | [밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 2 (교보문고)](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001810145)
   - **Hands-on Project**: *To be decided.* (This stage is yet to be implemented.)

4. **AI Paper Sharing**  
   - Members share and discuss papers on topics they find interesting.  
   - *This stage is still in the planning phase.*

## 🎯 Study Goals

- ✅ Build foundational and intermediate knowledge of AI to prepare for the AI-driven future.  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience by writing and implementing code.  
- ✅ Collaborate and grow with peers who share similar interests in AI and its applications in medicine.
