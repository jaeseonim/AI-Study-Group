# AI Study Group

This repository documents the AI study activities conducted by **RATEL**, a club at Dankook University College of Medicine.

## 🐾 Introduction to RATEL and the AI Study

RATEL is an academic club at Dankook University that focuses on book discussions and AI studies. The club was founded in 2024 by a group of peers from the same class, including myself. I currently serve as the AI study leader and have been managing the study sessions since its inception.

In March 2024, the group started with 14 members, and we welcomed 4 new members in September. As someone with no prior experience in AI or coding, I initially struggled to manage the study sessions effectively. However, I took on the responsibility as a leader and made continuous efforts to learn more, so I could better assist members with their questions.

We have now established a structured 4-step study plan as outlined below.

   - **Hands-on Project**: Apply algorithms introduced in the book to public image datasets.
     
3. **RNN (Recurent Neural Network)**
   - Book: [*Deep Learning from Scratch 2*](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4-%E5%BA%B7%E6%AF%85/dp/4873118360/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1B151TVWPHXCG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BSJwVIIOHE6YoQRMnC_Atr3guHh3CZHN5o796dAWFCGXHennOFOA9HtC0IZoe1CJtJ0oPnqDNoRs-canO1-hMc40iIbxdHqvwlFuqtQSmvM0gsVsVZIPSocHRK7Oqk3I_656qKr9kMZMY5At-y66W6EQq3oiPyyI8iVXxi57bkvJQ3MoW2yDfK9UwFtMsXw4.0PSLzqvIrvIzAOwXhAdPtva0PO_7I2eb8XxTzyORF-U&dib_tag=se&keywords=%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8BDeep+Learning&qid=1737986594&s=books&sprefix=%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8Bdeep+learning%2Cstripbooks%2C196&sr=1-4) ([밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 2](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001810145))
   - **Hands-on Project**: *To be decided.* (This stage is yet to be implemented.)

4. **AI Paper Sharing**  
   - Members share and discuss papers on topics they find interesting.  
   - *This stage is still in the planning phase.*

## 🎯 Study Goals

- ✅ Build foundational and intermediate knowledge of AI to prepare for the AI-driven future.  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience by writing and implementing code.  
- ✅ Collaborate and grow with peers who share similar interests in AI and its applications in medicine.
