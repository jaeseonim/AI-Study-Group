# AI Study Group

This repository outlines the AI study activities organized by RATEL, an academic club at Dankook University College of Medicine.

## 🤖 Introduction to RATEL and the AI Study

RATEL is an academic club at Dankook University that focuses on book discussions and AI studies. The club was founded in 2024 by a group of peers from the same class, including myself. I currently serve as the AI study leader and have been managing the study sessions since its inception.

In March 2024, the group started with 14 members, and we welcomed 4 new members in September. With no prior experience in AI or coding, I initially faced challenges in managing the study sessions effectively. Nonetheless, I embraced my role as a leader and consistently worked to enhance my knowledge to better support members' questions.

We have now established a structured 4-step study plan as outlined below.

   - **Hands-on Project**: Apply CNN to public image datasets.

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
   - **Book**: [*Deep Learning from Scratch 2*](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4-%E5%BA%B7%E6%AF%85/dp/4873118360) | [밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 2](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001810145)
   - **Hands-on Project**: *To be decided.* (This stage is yet to be implemented.)

4. **Collaborative Paper Discussions**  
   - Members share and discuss papers on topics they find interesting.
   - **Status**: This stage is still in the planning phase.
   - **Tentative Plan**: Select papers based on relevance to AI in medicine or other areas of interest.

## 🎯 Study Goals

- ✅ Build foundational and intermediate knowledge of AI to prepare for the AI-driven future.  
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience by writing and implementing code.  
- ✅ Collaborate and grow with peers who share similar interests in AI and its applications in medicine.
